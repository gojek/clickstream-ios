# Welcome to Clickstream!

Clickstream is an event agnostic, real-time data ingestion platform. Clickstream allows apps to maintain a long-running connection to send data in real-time.

The word “Clickstream” is a trail of digital breadcrumbs left by users as they click their way through a website or mobile app. It is loaded with valuable customer information for businesses and its analysis and usage has emerged as a powerful data source.

**To know more about Clickstream, you can read our [Medium post](https://www.gojek.io/blog/introducing-clickstream?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=medium%20blog&utm_campaign=blog_clickstream)**

**Clickstream provide end to end solution for ingestion platform purposes. For setup the infrastructure please check [raccoon](https://github.com/odpf/raccoon)**


## Architecture

#### Mobile Library Architecture

![Clickstream HLD](https://github.com/gojekfarm/clickstream-ios/blob/main/Resources/clickstream-HLD.png)


## Key features

-   Simple and lightweight
    
-   Remotely Configurable
    
-   Support for real-time data
    
-   Multiple QoS support (QoS0 and QoS1)
    
-   Typesafe and reusable schemas
    
-   Efficient payloads
    
-   In-built data aggregation

## Installation

#### CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Clickstream into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:

    pod 'Clickstream'

#### Swift Package Manager
[SPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler. Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Clickstream as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/gojek/clickstream-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
    ]

## Usage

### Initialization

```swift
class SampleClass {

    private var clickstream: ClickStream?
    
    func initialiseClickstream() {
        let url = URL(string: "ws://mock.clickstream.com/events")!
        let headers = ["Authorization": "Bearer dummy-token"]
        let networkConfigs = NetworkConfigurations(baseURL: url, headers: headers)
        let constraints = ClickstreamConstraints(maxConnectionRetries: 5)
        let classification = ClickstreamEventClassification()
        self.clickstream = try? Clickstream.initialise(networkConfiguration: networkConfigs,
        constraints: constraints,
        eventClassification: classification)
    }
}
```
	    
#### ClickstreamConstraints

Holds the configurations for clickstream. These constraints allow for fine-grained control over the library behaviour like duration between retries, flush events when app goes in background, etc.

|  Description|  Variable|	Type|	Default value|
|--|--|--|--|
|  Maximum number of retries for connection| maxConnectionRetries |	Int|30|
|  Maximum retry interval between two successive retries (seconds)| maxConnectionRetries |	Int|30|
|  Maximum number of retries for connection| maxConnectionRetryInterval |	TimeInterval|30|
| Maximum retry interval post a premature network disconnection (seconds) | maxRetryIntervalPostPrematureDisconnection |TimeInterval|30|
| Maximum number of retries post a premature network disconnection | maxRetriesPostPrematureDisconnection |Int	|10|
| Max Pint Interval (seconds) | maxPingInterval |TimeInterval	|15|
|This array holds all priority configs| priorities |[Priority]	|[Priority()]|
|This is flag which determines whether the contained events be flushed when the app moves to background|	flushOnBackground|Boolean|false
|Wait time for the connection termination|connectionTerminationTimerWaitTime|	TimeInterval|8|
|  Max retry interval for timimg out a batch| maxRequestAckTimeout |TimeInterval	|6|
|  Max retires allowed batch|  maxRetriesPerBatch|Int	|20|
|  Max retry cache size on disk and memory (bytes)|  maxRetryCacheSize|	Bytes|5000000|
|  Connection retry duration|  connectionRetryDuration|	TimeInterval|3|
    
	
##### Priority
Holds the priorities defined in the ClickStreamConstraints

|  Description|  Variable|	Type|	Default value|
|--|--|--|--|
|  QoS| priority |	Int|0|
|  Identifier (Example: "realTime" / "standard")| identifier |	String|"realTime"|
|   Maximum batch size for this priority (in bytes)| maxBatchSize |	Bytes|50000|
|  Maximum time duration between two batches (in seconds)| maxTimeBetweenTwoBatches |	TimeInterval|10|
|  Maximum cache size for this priority (in bytes)| maxCacheSize |	Bytes|5000000|



#### ClickStreamEventClassification
Holds the Event classification for ClickStream.
|  Description|  Variable|	Type|	Default value|
|--|--|--|--|
|  Holds all the eventTypes| eventTypes |	EventClassifier|[EventClassifier(identifier: "realTime", eventNames: []), EventClassifier(identifier: "instant", eventNames: [])]|



### Push Event
Pushes event to Clickstream SDK

```swift
private func trackClickstreamEvent(message: Message) {
    self.clickStream?.trackEvent(with: message)
}
```
    
### Destroy Instance
Destroy instance of Clickstream, for example can be called when user logs out of the app.

```swift
ClickStream.destroy()
```
